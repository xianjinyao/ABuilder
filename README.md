# ABuilder
If you want to build any code, you can use this project. Let’s make it stronger.

The reason why I want to build this project is that I think Java is a static lang, and I can give it a template to render it or to finish a simple web project with basic thing like Bean, DAO, or even make it to build a configuration xml file. It can render a Java from template with data which came from datasource like MySQL, mongodb or others.

And I want to build some datasource optional cmd in this project for someone convenience. 

The project needed as follow:
1. mako
2. MySQLdb
3. ...I want more wheels to use

Introduce myself: freshman.
