# ABuilder
Every code you want to build, use this project, and lets make it stronger.

The first time I want to build this project. Because I think that Java is a static lang, and I can give it a template to render it to finish a simple web project with basic thing like Bean, DAO, or even make it build a configuration xml file.
It can render a Java from template with data which came from datasource like MySQL, mongodb, or others.

And I want to build some datasource optional cmd in this project for someone convenience. 

The project needed as follow:
1. mako
2. MySQLdb
3. ...I want more wheel to use

Introduce myself: freshman.

Anyway, who want to contact me for this project, you can send me email.
